# Fizmat-Forum

## Description
Fizmat Forum is a comfortable place for all Fizmat students where you can ask any question and discuss different topics.  
This app is in russian.

You can look for threads on different subjects, like them, and search for answers in comments section.
Also you can filter the threads by a specified tag and sort them by different criteria.  
Register to join the forum and be able to create your own threads and answer to others.  
Futhermore, this app has an open API which gives you opportunities to get a filtered list of threads or create/delete threads if you have an account.

## Implementation
This app was made using Flask framework on [Python 3](https://python.org) language and deployed on [heroku](https://heroku.com).  
We created different forms based on FlaskForm to create threads, leave comments or answer to them. Also we created different classes for each type of columns to operate with our database easily.  
To beautify the app we used [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com).

You can find all needed packages in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/ninjakamushek/Fizmat-Forum/blob/master/requirements.txt).  
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install all required packages.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
